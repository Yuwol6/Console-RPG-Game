# ConsoleRpg
This program is a small C# console game built to practice OOP design, game state management and core programming fundamentals.

It is recommended that this game is run on full screen.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022**.
3. Run the project (Ctrl + F5) to build and run the game.

## How to Play
1. Enter your hero's name.
2. Choose whether each party is controlled by a human player or computer.
3. Take turns selecting actions for your heroes to attack enemies, equip gear, or use potions. The default setup is human player for the hero party, and a computer for the enemy party.
4. Progress through the stages and defeat the boss to win the game.

## Tips
- The hero character will do one more PUNCH damage for every stage cleared.
- The yellow door stages are farming stages, but contain more enemies each time it's entered.
- The black door contains the boss enemy, SATAN.
- Playing manually as the human player could result in more wins.
- Higher ranked gear will do more Gear Attack damage, after being equipped (try to get a legendary gear!)
